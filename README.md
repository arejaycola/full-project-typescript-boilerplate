## Background

I am hoping that this will provide a good starting point for any project using TypeScript, React, Jest, ESLint, and Stylint.

Make sure you check out the [Style Guide](docs/STYLE.md).

## Getting things running...

Running `npm install` in the project root (where ever package.json lives) should get things installed correctly.

Once you have finished installing the application use `npm start` to start the application in development mode.


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
